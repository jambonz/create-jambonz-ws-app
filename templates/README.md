{% if tts %}
### /hello-world
A simple "hello, world" application using text to speech.
{% endif %}

{% if echo %}
### /echo
A application that prompts the caller for speech, transcribes it and speaks it back along with the recognized confidence factor.
{% endif %}

{% if chatgpt3 %}
### /chat-gpt3/:apiKey
A basic voicebot for Openai's [GPT-3](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) large language model (LLM).  This service requires an API Key from openai which in this case should be presented in the path of the http request.
> Note: this is done only to show how to retrieve information from the incoming http request if necessary, in a production app secret information like this should be presented via environment variables.
